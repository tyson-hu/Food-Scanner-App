# CI Improvements - Enhanced Robustness and Reliability

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the CI system to prevent builds from getting stuck and timing out.

## Problem Analysis

The original CI system had several issues that led to frequent timeouts and stuck builds:

1. **Insufficient timeout handling** - Only 15 minutes for entire build+test process
2. **Poor simulator state management** - Simulators could get stuck in various states
3. **Inadequate cleanup** - Not enough cleanup between retries
4. **No progress monitoring** - No way to detect if xcodebuild was actually stuck
5. **Limited retry strategy** - Only 3 attempts with basic simulator reset
6. **No system resource management** - Memory pressure could cause issues
7. **Network dependency issues** - Tests could hang on network operations
8. **Permission dialog interruptions** - Camera permission popups causing test hangs
9. **Incorrect bundle identifiers** - Permission granting failing due to wrong bundle ID

## Solution Overview

The new CI system implements a multi-layered approach to prevent stuck builds:

### 1. Enhanced Timeout Management
- **Overall timeout**: 15 minutes (was 12)
- **Per-attempt timeout**: 15 minutes with progress monitoring (was 10)
- **Stuck detection**: Kills processes that show no activity for 5 minutes (was 3)
- **Destination timeout**: 60 seconds (was 180)
- **Individual test timeouts**: 30s default, 60s maximum
- **Progressive backoff**: 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s between retries

### 2. Robust Simulator Management
- **Fresh simulator creation** for each CI run
- **Enhanced boot process** with stability checks
- **Pre-test simulator reset** for clean state every attempt
- **Comprehensive cleanup** between retries
- **Health monitoring** before each test run
- **Automatic recovery** from simulator issues

### 3. Progress Monitoring System
- **Real-time monitoring** of xcodebuild progress
- **Log file analysis** to detect activity
- **Automatic process termination** for stuck builds
- **Detailed logging** for debugging
- **More frequent checks**: 20s intervals (was 30s)

### 4. Enhanced Retry Logic
- **5 attempts** instead of 3 (configurable)
- **Intelligent cleanup** between retries
- **System resource management**
- **Simulator state verification**

### 5. **NEW: 100% Offline CI Mode**
- **Network test exclusion** for maximum stability
- **Conditional compilation** to skip network tests
- **Dedicated offline test plan** for CI
- **Local development support** for full testing

### 6. **NEW: Permission Handling System**
- **Camera permission granting** to prevent permission popups
- **Photo library permission** handling for complete coverage
- **Microphone permission** support for future features
- **Correct bundle identifier** (tysonhu.foodscanner)
- **Multiple grant points** for redundancy
- **Timing optimization** - permissions granted after simulator boot

## Usage in CI

The enhanced CI system is now much more robust:

```yaml
- name: Preboot iOS 26 (create fresh iPhone 16; robust detection)
  run: |
    # Inline simulator creation with Python for reliability
    # Creates fresh simulator for each CI run

- name: Build & Unit Tests (Offline CI plan, no coverage)
  timeout-minutes: 15
  run: |
    ./scripts/ci-test-runner.sh "$DEST_ID" "./DerivedData"

- name: Cleanup Simulators
  if: always()
  run: |
    xcrun simctl shutdown all || true
    xcrun simctl delete all || true
```

## Performance Metrics

6. **Cache optimization**: Further reduce build times
7. **Test parallelization**: Run compatible tests in parallel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Simulator creation fails**
   - Check iOS runtime availability
   - Verify device type exists
   - Check system resources

2. **Tests still timeout**
   - Increase `XCODEBUILD_TIMEOUT` if needed
   - Check for test-specific issues
   - Review simulator health

3. **Cleanup issues**
   - Run `./scripts/simulator-manager.sh cleanup-all`
   - Check for permission issues
   - Verify simulator state

4. **Network test failures in local development**
   - Use `./scripts/test-local-network.sh` for full testing
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify external services are available

5. **Permission dialog still appears**
   - Check bundle identifier is correct (tysonhu.foodscanner)
   - Verify permissions are granted after simulator boot
   - Check timing - permissions need 2-second delay to take effect
   - Ensure permissions are granted at multiple points

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check simulator status
xcrun simctl list devices

# Check available runtimes
xcrun simctl list runtimes

# Check device types
xcrun simctl list devicetypes

# Manual cleanup
./scripts/simulator-manager.sh cleanup-all

# Run local network tests
./scripts/test-local-network.sh

# Check CI offline mode
grep -r "CI_OFFLINE_MODE" FoodScannerTests/

# Check permission status
xcrun simctl privacy <simulator_udid> status camera tysonhu.foodscanner
xcrun simctl privacy <simulator_udid> status photos tysonhu.foodscanner
xcrun simctl privacy <simulator_udid> status microphone tysonhu.foodscanner

# Grant permissions manually
xcrun simctl privacy <simulator_udid> grant camera tysonhu.foodscanner
xcrun simctl privacy <simulator_udid> grant photos tysonhu.foodscanner
xcrun simctl privacy <simulator_udid> grant microphone tysonhu.foodscanner
```
