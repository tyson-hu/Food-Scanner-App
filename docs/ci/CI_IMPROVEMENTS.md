# CI Improvements - Enhanced Robustness and Reliability

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the CI system to prevent builds from getting stuck and timing out.

## Problem Analysis

The original CI system had several issues that led to frequent timeouts and stuck builds:

1. **Insufficient timeout handling** - Only 15 minutes for entire build+test process
2. **Poor simulator state management** - Simulators could get stuck in various states
3. **Inadequate cleanup** - Not enough cleanup between retries
4. **No progress monitoring** - No way to detect if xcodebuild was actually stuck
5. **Limited retry strategy** - Only 3 attempts with basic simulator reset
6. **No system resource management** - Memory pressure could cause issues
7. **Network dependency issues** - Tests could hang on network operations

## Solution Overview

The new CI system implements a multi-layered approach to prevent stuck builds:

### 1. Enhanced Timeout Management
- **Overall timeout**: 25 minutes (was 15)
- **Per-attempt timeout**: 10 minutes with progress monitoring (was 12)
- **Stuck detection**: Kills processes that show no activity for 3 minutes (was 5)
- **Destination timeout**: 60 seconds (was 180)
- **Progressive backoff**: 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s between retries

### 2. Robust Simulator Management
- **Fresh simulator creation** for each CI run
- **Enhanced boot process** with stability checks
- **Pre-test simulator reset** for clean state every attempt
- **Comprehensive cleanup** between retries
- **Health monitoring** before each test run
- **Automatic recovery** from simulator issues

### 3. Progress Monitoring System
- **Real-time monitoring** of xcodebuild progress
- **Log file analysis** to detect activity
- **Automatic process termination** for stuck builds
- **Detailed logging** for debugging
- **More frequent checks**: 20s intervals (was 30s)

### 4. Enhanced Retry Logic
- **5 attempts** instead of 3 (configurable)
- **Intelligent cleanup** between retries
- **System resource management**
- **Simulator state verification**

### 5. **NEW: 100% Offline CI Mode**
- **Network test exclusion** for maximum stability
- **Conditional compilation** to skip network tests
- **Dedicated offline test plan** for CI
- **Local development support** for full testing

```

### Simulator Settings
```bash

   - Review simulator health

3. **Cleanup issues**
   - Run `./scripts/simulator-manager.sh cleanup-all`
   - Check for permission issues
   - Verify simulator state

4. **Network test failures in local development**
   - Use `./scripts/test-local-network.sh` for full testing
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify external services are available

### Debug Commands
