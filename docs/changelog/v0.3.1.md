# Changelog - Version 0.3.1

**Release Date**: October 2025  
**Focus**: Code Refactoring and Structure Improvements  
**Swift Version**: 6.2 with strict concurrency  
**iOS Target**: 26.0+

## 🎯 Version 0.3.1 Overview

This release focuses on comprehensive code refactoring to improve naming consistency, folder organization, and overall code maintainability. The changes make the codebase more intuitive and easier to navigate for developers.

## 🔄 Refactoring Changes

### Naming Consistency Improvements
- **Renamed Core Models**:
  - `FoodMinimalCard` → `FoodCard` (more intuitive name)
  - `FoodAuthoritativeDetail` → `FoodDetails` (clearer purpose)
  - `FdcFood` → `FdcProduct` (consistent with `OffProduct`)

### View and ViewModel Renaming
- **Renamed Views**:
  - `AddFoodSummaryView` → `FoodView` (main food display)
  - `AddFoodDetailView` → `FoodDetailsView` (detailed food display)
  - `AddFoodSearchView` → `FoodSearchView` (search interface)

- **Renamed ViewModels**:
  - `AddFoodSummaryViewModel` → `FoodViewModel`
  - `AddFoodDetailViewModel` → `FoodDetailsViewModel`
  - `AddFoodSearchViewModel` → `FoodSearchViewModel`

### Folder Structure Reorganization
- **New AddFood Structure**:
  ```
  Sources/Views/AddFood/
  ├── FoodView.swift                    # Main food display (shared)
  ├── FoodDetailsView.swift             # Detailed food display (shared)
  ├── AddFoodHomeView.swift             # Main entry point
  ├── Scanner/                          # 📷 Scanner screens
  │   ├── BarcodeScannerView.swift
  │   └── BarcodeSearchResultsView.swift
  ├── PhotoIntake/                      # 📸 Photo recognition
  │   └── PhotoIntakeView.swift
  └── Search/                           # 🔍 Text search
      └── FoodSearchView.swift
  ```

### Test File Updates
- **Renamed Test Files**:
  - `AddFoodDetailViewModelTests.swift` → `FoodDetailsViewModelTests.swift`
  - `AddFoodSearchViewModelTests.swift` → `FoodSearchViewModelTests.swift`

## 🏗️ Architectural Improvements

### Better Organization
- **Grouped by Function**: Views are now organized by their primary function (Scanner, PhotoIntake, Search)
- **Shared Components**: `FoodView` and `FoodDetailsView` are at the root level as they're used by multiple search methods
- **Clear Separation**: Each search method has its own dedicated folder

### Improved Maintainability
- **Intuitive Naming**: Function and file names now clearly indicate their purpose
- **Consistent Patterns**: FDC and OFF models follow similar naming conventions
- **Easy Navigation**: Developers can quickly find the right component

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Code Updates
- **Updated All References**: All imports and references across the codebase updated
- **Function Renaming**: Internal function names updated to match new naming
- **Documentation Updates**: All documentation updated to reflect new structure

### Quality Assurance
- **Tests Pass**: All 78 tests continue to pass
- **Build Success**: Compiles without errors or warnings
- **Linting Clean**: 0 violations (SwiftLint + SwiftFormat)
- **Swift 6 Compliance**: Maintains strict concurrency compliance

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### Updated Documentation
- **Project Structure**: Updated `docs/architecture/project-structure.md`
- **API Documentation**: Updated `docs/api/README.md` and `docs/api/data-journey.md`
- **Development Guides**: Updated development documentation
- **Main README**: Updated main documentation index

### New Structure Benefits
- **Clearer Navigation**: Easy to find any file or component
- **Logical Grouping**: Views grouped by functionality
- **Consistent Naming**: Follows established patterns
- **Future-Ready**: Clean structure for implementing 0.4.0 features

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### For Developers
- **Intuitive Naming**: `FoodView` and `FoodDetailsView` are more descriptive than `AddFoodSummaryView` and `AddFoodDetailView`
- **Better Organization**: Views grouped by function make it easier to find specific functionality
- **Consistent Patterns**: FDC and OFF models follow similar naming conventions
- **Easy Maintenance**: Clear structure makes it easier to modify and extend

### For Code Quality
- **Zero Violations**: All linting rules pass
- **Clean Build**: No errors or warnings
- **Test Coverage**: All tests continue to pass
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation updates

## 🚀 Future Impact

### 0.4.0 Preparation
- **Clean Foundation**: New structure provides solid foundation for 0.4.0 features
- **Clear Separation**: Easy to add new search methods or modify existing ones
- **Maintainable Code**: Consistent naming and organization support future development

### Development Efficiency
- **Faster Navigation**: Developers can quickly find the right component
- **Clearer Intent**: Function and file names clearly indicate their purpose
- **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the structure more quickly

## 📋 Migration Notes

### For Developers
- **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality remains the same
- **Updated Imports**: Some import statements may need updating
- **New File Locations**: Some files have moved to new folders
- **Consistent Naming**: All references use new naming conventions

### For Testing
- **Test Files Renamed**: Test files follow new naming conventions
- **All Tests Pass**: No test functionality changed
- **Same Coverage**: Test coverage maintained

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase's maintainability and developer experience while maintaining all existing functionality and preparing for future feature development.
