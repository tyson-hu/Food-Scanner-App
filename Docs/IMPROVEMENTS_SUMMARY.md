**Benefits:**
- Improved code maintainability with smaller, focused files
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier navigation and understanding of model relationships
- Reduced cognitive load when working with specific model types

### 4. Caching Layer Implementation

**Files Created:**
- `Food Scanner/Services/Caching/FDCCacheService.swift` - Core caching service
- `Food Scanner/Services/Networking/FDCCachedClient.swift` - Cached client wrapper

**Files Modified:**
- `Food Scanner/App/AppEnvironment.swift` - Integrated caching into app environment
- `Food Scanner/Views/Settings/SettingsView.swift` - Added cache management UI

**Features:**
- **Smart Caching**: 7-day TTL with LRU eviction policy
- **Dual Cache**: Separate caches for search results and food details
- **Cache Statistics**: Real-time cache metrics in Settings
- **Cache Management**: Manual cache clearing capability
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic cleanup when cache size exceeds limits

**Benefits:**
- Improved app performance with reduced network requests
- Better offline experience with cached data
- Reduced API usage and costs
- Enhanced user experience with faster data loading

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### Dependency Injection Enhancement
- Integrated caching service into the app environment
- Maintained clean separation between cached and non-cached clients
- Preserved existing dependency injection patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Implemented comprehensive error categorization
- Added user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Maintained proper error propagation throughout the call stack

### Code Organization
- Split large model files into domain-specific modules
- Maintained backward compatibility through re-export pattern
- Improved code discoverability and maintainability

## üìä Performance Improvements

### Caching Benefits
- **Search Results**: Instant loading for previously searched terms
- **Food Details**: Reduced API calls for frequently accessed foods
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat
- **Network Efficiency**: Reduced bandwidth usage and API rate limiting

### Code Organization Benefits
- **Faster Compilation**: Smaller files compile more quickly
- **Better IDE Performance**: Faster symbol resolution and autocomplete
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Smaller files reduce likelihood of conflicts

## üîß Technical Details

### Cache Configuration
```swift
struct CacheConfiguration {
    let maxAge: TimeInterval = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 7 days
    let maxSize: Int = 1000 // Maximum cached items
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```swift
enum FDCError: LocalizedError {
    case invalidURL
    case invalidResponse
    case httpError(Int)
    case networkError(Error)
    case decodingError(Error)
    case noResults
    case serverUnavailable
    
    var errorDescription: String? { /* User-friendly messages */ }
    var recoverySuggestion: String? { /* Actionable advice */ }
}
```

### Model Organization
- **FDCPublicModels**: Core public API models
- **FDCProxyModels**: External API response models
- **FDCFoodDetailModels**: Detailed food information
- **FDCNutrientModels**: Nutrition-specific models
- **FDCUtilityModels**: Generic utility types
- **FDCLegacyModels**: Backward compatibility
- **FDCConversionExtensions**: Model conversion logic
